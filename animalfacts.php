				Cats are domesticated carnivorous mammals that are valued by humans for their companionship and rodent hunting abilities. They are thought to have been domesticated in regions along the Eastern Mediterranean Sea around 7500-7200 BC. Cats are known for their quick reflexes, sharp teeth, retractable claws, and strong senses. Cats benefit from their strong smelling abilities and natural night vision. They are lovely animals and are furry 	friends to many humans around the world.

				Dogs are domesticated and selectively bred carnivores that have lived alongside humans for thousands of years. Humans have been breeding dogs for hundreds of years with the goal of bringing out desirable traits within the different breeds. This process is viewed as a relatively controversial development today, as many dog breeds have led to members of that breed enduring negative health defects. Nevertheless, dogs are intelligent animals that are trusted within human society with many different roles relating to companionship, herding, hunting, therapy, and more. These animals make great friends.

			<p id=factsText>
				Koalas are Australian mammals that typically reside in eucalypt woodlands. They are asocial animals that spend most of their time alone (barring the bonding between mother koalas and their offspring) and they consume eucalyptus. They are marsupials, which means that they have pouches in which females of the species birth and host their young for the first several months after the birthing period. They are subject to intense habitat loss, and are a species that must be protected from human interference.

				Foxes are omnivorous mammals that have life spans of up to three years. They have diverse diets, with some species morphing what they consume to what is available in the area (such as the crab-eating fox!). Foxes are sometimes found in urban areas, living with close proximity to humans. They also suffer from habitat loss and are beautiful animals that must be protected.
