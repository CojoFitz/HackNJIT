# HackNJIT
NJIT Fall Hackathon 2021


 **Inspiration**
We wanted to build something cool related to the Themes of the HackNJIT 2021 event, namely "animals" and "outer space". This project was more for fun than it was for competition, as none of our group members had ever been to a Hackathon before and we wanted to test out our skills.

**What it does**
We created a website and some minigames related to animals and outer space, as well as one larger game featuring animals in space fighting off poachers.

**How we built it**
We used PHP, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, C# (in the Unity Game engine), and Python to make this website. It was a lot of trial and error as well as discussion in figuring out what exactly we could make with our skills, and how we could put it together.

**Challenges we ran into**
Lots of CSS errors, and we had difficulty merging the Python files with our PHP-based website.
